# binaryOpticMasks
Given a set of axicon or axilens parameters, this suite of codes will follow a number of steps to produce GDS drawings of the masks which would be required to produce such a binary optic

Operations performed
    Calculation of required phase profile
    Wrapping of phase profile around a pi shift in the optical path
    Conversion of this phase profile to a discrete set of levels
    Generation of required masks to be produced to etch this profile
    Conversion of these masks to GDSII format, suitable for photolithography gurus!
    

#How to use?
Every runs from the OpticParams.m file
Set the required parameters and simply run from there, sever
